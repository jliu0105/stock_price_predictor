## Introduction 
Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of artificial neural network designed to handle sequences of data, making them ideal for time series analysis. This project uses an RNN with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells to predict the future stock price of Google based on historical data.

### Features 
* Stock price prediction using historical data
* Recurrent Neural Networks with LSTM cells
* Visualization of the predicted stock prices
* Easy-to-use command line interface

## Requirement
* Python 3.8 +
* Numpy
* Pandas
* TensorFlow
* Scikit-learn

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jliu0105/stock_price_predictor.git
```
